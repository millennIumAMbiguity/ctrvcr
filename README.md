  <a>Stylized Minecraft Shader that brings artifacts from CRT and VCR / VHS</a>
</div>

<br>


The CTR VCR shader brings the nostalgic feel of old CRT monitors and VHS tapes to your Minecraft experience, adding subtle but impactful visual artifacts and distortions. Inspired by the retro charm of analog technology, this shader introduces static noise, light distortions, chromatic aberration, scan-lines, and more to give the game a vintage, glitchy aesthetic. While these effects evoke a sense of retro realism, they are finely tuned to ensure they don't overwhelm the visuals, making the shader perfect for regular gameplay. Enjoy the blend of modern gameplay with a retro-futuristic vibe that keeps the world immersive, stylish, and entirely playable.
